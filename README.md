# Dependable Public Announcement Server
High Dependable Systems Project: DPAS.
This is Java API that wants to solve the problems concerned with the emergence of fake news and the need for trusted sources of information. We want to make sure that relevant public information and facts can be posted, tracked and verified.
	The main specifications are:
- Every user of this system has his/her own Announcement Board where only he/she can post announcements.
- There's a General Board where everyone is able to post announcements.
- Users are accountable for the announcements they post
- Users can read all the announcements of other users and obtain their cronological order
- When posting announcements, users can refer to previous announcements posted by them or other users.

## Server API
This is a Java API. All the methods return either Java primitive type objects or JSONs.
There are 5 methods you can use:
```bash
register(PublicKey publicKey, String name) : returns int
post(PublicKey key, String message, int[] announcs) : returns int
postGeneral(PublicKey key, String message, int[] announcs) : returns int
read(PublicKey key, int number) : returns JSONObject
readGeneral(int number) : returns JSONObject
```

## Exceptions Guide

Each error code sent by the server is translated into an exception client side.

- -1 -> UserNotRegistered
- -2 -> AlreadyRegistered
- -3 -> InvalidPublicKey
- -4 -> MessageTooBig
- -5 -> InvalidAnnouncement
- -6 -> InvalidPostsNumber
- -7 -> UnknownPublicKey
- -8 -> ErrorReadingFile
- -9 -> ErrorWrittingFile
- -10 ->  TooMuchAnnouncements

## Application Example

We also developed an example of an application that uses the DPAS API. You can find it in the Client module. Hope it helps to better understand how it works! (The application is currently "installed on user1 pc". This means that the app only knows user1 keypair. All the other keys are the public keys of the server and other users so, in order to try our app, you can only use it as user1).
